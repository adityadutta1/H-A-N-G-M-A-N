          <strong>Hangman</strong> is a popular yet grim intellectual game. A cruel computer hides a word from you. Letter by letter you try to guess it. If you fail, you'll be              hanged, if you win, you'll survive. See also: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)">Wikipedia</a></em>

        You probably played the game at least once in your life; now you can actually create this game yourself!</div>

         <h3>Description</h3>
         <br>
         Let's have a brief overview of what I have build in this project. Here is what the gameplay should look like:
         <br>
          <ol>
             <li>In the main menu, a player can choose to either play or exit the game;</li>
             <li>If the user chooses to play, the computer picks a word from a list: this will be the riddle;</li>
             <li>The computer asks the player to enter a letter that (s)he thinks is in the word;</li>
             <li>If there's no such letter in the word and this letter hasn't been tried before, the computer counts it as a miss. A player can afford only up to 8 misses before                    the game is over;</li>
             <li>If the letter does occur in the word, the computer notifies the player. If there are letters left to guess, the computer invites the player to go on.</li>
             <li>When the entire word is uncovered, it's a victory! The game calculates the final score and goes back to the main menu.</li>
         </ol>
