        Hangman is a popular yet grim intellectual game. A cruel computer hides a word from you. Letter by letter you try to guess it. If you fail, you'll be hanged, if                   you win, you'll survive. See also: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)">Wikipedia</a></em>

        You probably played the game at least once in your life; now you can actually create this game yourself!</div>
